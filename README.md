Random R code for a variety of tasks
This is just a collection of random code for a variety of purposes not directly related to analysis or modeling but useful. For instance texting your phone is useful at the end of R code that takes a long time - as it can notify you when it is done. This allows you to run code on a remote computer and know when to go get the results.
